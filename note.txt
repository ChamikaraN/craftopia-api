I have simple online shop that sells craft items. for this shop im using express and mongodb as my backend.

in this mongodb database i have collections for users, products, category, and orders. 

can you suggest me best collection schemas for each of them ?


this is my updated users collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  username: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
  phone: String,
  role: String,  
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}


this is my updated Category Collection:

{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  image: String,
  status: boolean,
